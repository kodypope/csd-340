        <h2>The Actor that Was</h2>
        <p class="intro">I wanted to be an actor when I was very young, maybe about five years old. 
            I wanted to be in TV and film, so I set my heart on doing just that in middle school. 
            In high school, I was in everything theater arts that I could be, and I was in band, 
            marching band, show choir, choir theater, one-act, stage plays, you name it. 
        </p>
        <p>When it came time for college, I attended a prestigious acting school in Hollywood. 
            <span class="sentence">I received a bachelor's degree in the fine arts for acting there.</span> 
            I still love acting and want to be an actor, but TV and film didn't work out. 
        </p>
        <p>My second passion, however, was technology, which brought me here today to learn 
            software development at Bellevue University. I am pleased to have discovered 
            Python, Java, and SQL, and now I'm learning HTML, CSS, and intermediate Java. 
            And to tell you the truth, it is pretty exciting.
        </p>
        <p>I also moved to Seattle, Washington, from Los Angeles, California, where he will 
            help me in the tech industry, so I've been told. It seems like Seattle is 
            supposed to be the place to be. I don't know if that's true or not, and that's 
            not exactly why I moved here, but I am here nonetheless and loving every minute.
